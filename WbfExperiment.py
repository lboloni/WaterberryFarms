Waterberry Farms Experiments: functions helping to run experiments
with the Waterberry Farms benchmark.

Many of the functions here were using a design pattern that was relying on interactive terminal interaction. This was not very practical, so it will be 
gradually factored out. 

As of 2025-03-21 this will be (gradually) refactored to use the Experiment/Run 
configuration framework.
