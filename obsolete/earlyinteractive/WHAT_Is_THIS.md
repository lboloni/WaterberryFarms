# What are these files?

Early in the development of the Waterberry Farms framework, we developed a framework that allowed the interactive control of the robots in the simulation, with specific interactive visualization tools. 

These were rarely used, so they are moved here. In general, the notebooks here:

* Were typically only debugged to work in jupyter notebooks. They are often not runnable when run through vscode.
* They might not keep up with the rest of the codebase.
